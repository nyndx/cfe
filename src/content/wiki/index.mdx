# Business Development

Cfe Management consulting indicates both the industry of, and the practice of helping organizations improve their performance, primarily through the analysis of existing business problems and development of plans for improvement.

Our organization hires the services of management consultants for a number of reasons, including gaining external (and presumably objective) advice and access to the consultants' specialized expertise.

Because of our exposure to and relationships with numerous organizations, our consulting firm is also said to be aware of industry "best practices", although the transferability of such practices from one organization to another may be problematic depending on the situation under consideration.

A best practice is a technique, method, process, activity, incentive, or reward that is believed to be more effective at delivering a particular outcome than any other technique, method, process, etc. when applied to a particular condition or circumstance. The idea is that with proper processes, checks, and testing, a desired outcome can be delivered with fewer problems and unforeseen complications. Best practices can also be defined as the most efficient (least amount of effort) and effective (best results) way of accomplishing a task, based on repeatable procedures that have proven themselves over time for large numbers of people.

A given best practice is only applicable to particular condition or circumstance and may have to be modified or adapted for similar circumstances. In addition, a "best" practice can evolve to become better as improvements are discovered.

Despite the need to improve on processes as the environment changes, best-practice is considered by some as a business buzzword used to describe the process of developing and following a standard way of doing things that multiple organizations can use for management, policy, and especially software systems.

As the term has become more popular, some organizations have begun using the term "best practices" to refer to what are in fact merely 'rules', causing a linguistic drift in which a new term such as "good ideas" is needed to refer to what would previously have been called "best practices." No matter what is called, Cfe Consulting Services aims always at the best result for its clients.

Our firm provides also organizational change management assistance, development of coaching skills, technology implementation, strategy development, or operational improvement services. Cfe Consulting Services generally brings its own, proprietary methodologies or frameworks to guide the identification of problems, and to serve as the basis for recommendations for more effective or efficient ways of performing business tasks.
